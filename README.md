#UI Questionnarie

##DESIGN

*The design for the task is provided in Figma format (.fig) that can be accessed via the Figma web app or Figma desktop app.

##BUILD & LOGIC

*Please use the prototype provided to build a simple questionnaire application. In addition to all of the questionnaire steps, a responsive design has been provided for the splash screen as a guide. Please use your best judgement to build the rest of the step pages in a mobile responsive manner. Feel free to make design assumptions for the mobile version.
The app should take the user through a series of questions and present 1 out of 3 possible options -- the values table below has the score data -- culminating in a user’s wellness score. This value should then be multiplied by their age factor for a final wellness score and their resulting wellness status, ie **“Needs Help”**, **“Doing Well”**, or **“Champion”**.
